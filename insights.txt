// Regarding action events and buttons
Regarding MainPage.xaml and MainPage.xaml.cs
Action event is referenced form xaml element through Click"name_of_method"
Method stub can be generated from the properties window, using the ligtning button(just no)

// Regarding MediaCapture.InitializeAsync() called form MainPage.xaml.cs 
To access the LED the Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture.(VideoDeviceController.TorchControl) is used.
The MediaCapture object shouldn't be initialized from the MTA thread, because of risk of 
undefined behaviour(experienced that). It should be done in the STA thread or the main UI thread.
 
The Dispatch class isn't referencabel form MainPage.xaml.cs. Posts suggesting it dates from 2013.
